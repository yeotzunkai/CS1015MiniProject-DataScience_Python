### This repository consists of 3 main folders
###  - [Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis Folder](https://github.com/yeotzunkai/CS1015MiniProject-DataScience_Python/tree/main/DSAI%20Project/Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)
#### Notebooks of Data cleaning and EDA can be found here
###  - [Prediction Models folder](https://github.com/yeotzunkai/CS1015MiniProject-DataScience_Python/tree/main/DSAI%20Project/Model)
#### Notebooks of Exploring Prediction Models and Individual Prediction Models can be found here.
#### [Price_Predictor.ipynb](https://github.com/yeotzunkai/CS1015MiniProject-DataScience_Python/blob/main/DSAI%20Project/Model/Price_Predictor.ipynb)
#### Contains functions (predict(model,x,y)) to predict price of a 2020 Hyundai Elantra SE IVT (Values can be changed to predict other cars)
###  - [Dataset Folder](https://github.com/yeotzunkai/CS1015MiniProject-DataScience_Python/tree/main/DSAI%20Project/Dataset)
#### Original Data set and Cleaned Data set can be found here

## Problem Definition 
### 1. Are we able to predict a car price based on its features?
### 2. Which model would be the best to predict it?
---
## Predictive Models explored
### â‹… Linear Regression
### â‹… K-Nearest neighbours
### â‹… Decision Tree
### â‹… Random Forest 
### â‹… Graph Boosting 
--- 
## Conclusion
#### Random Forest Regression was found to have higher accuracy in predicting car prices.
#### Brand and the year the car was manufactured have higher linear correlation value with price.
#### Data in data set was not enough to predict luxury car brands but enough to cater to general public in predicting widely used cars in general
